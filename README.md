# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a browser-based **Etch-A-Sketch** project made to show my incipient **DOM manipulation** skills and practice using **Flexbox** for layout, as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.

## Project Description

In this project, I built a digital sketchpad, similar to an Etch-A-Sketch, using JavaScript and CSS. The goal was to create a 16x16 grid of square divs that change color as the mouse hovers over them, simulating a drawing effect. Users can also customize the grid size and interact with dynamic coloring options.

### Core Features
- **16x16 grid creation** with JavaScript and Flexbox.
- **Hover effect** that changes the color of the squares as the user moves the mouse over them.
- **Responsive grid size**: A button allows the user to set the number of squares per side, with a maximum of 100.
- **Random color mode**: Each interaction with the squares can generate random RGB values.
- **Darkening effect**: Progressive darkening of squares by 10% on each hover until fully black.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Basic structure and button functionality.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox for layout and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For grid generation, DOM manipulation, event listeners, and dynamic styling.

## Learning Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.
- Practice using **Flexbox** for creating grid-like layouts.
- Implement interactive features through **event listeners**.
- Apply concepts like **dynamic user input** and **randomized styling**.

## How to Use
1. Open the app and hover over the grid to start drawing.
2. Optionally, change the grid size using the slider.
3. Optionally, activate the extra features for random colors and progressive darkening.
4. Have fun!
